# English Irregular Plurals

Plain JSON file containing a list of irregular English nouns with their irregular plural. Derived from WordNet.

Most plurals are just built adding `s` or `es`. This list contains (or should contain) all the other ones: `wolf` => `wolves`, `tomato` => `tomatoes`, `cactus` => `cacti` etc.

Use the singular word as the key.


- Some irregular plurals, where the plural is simply rule based, is not present in the list, for instance
`bus` => `buses` or `chef` => `chefs`. 
- Moreover, some obvious ones, like `woman` => `women`, is not in the Wordnet exceptions (while `man` => `men` is here - hum).
- Even more, `bus` => `busses` is generally considered as incorrect.

The list is kept as is. See `english-plurals` for helper functions on this module which correct the issues.
